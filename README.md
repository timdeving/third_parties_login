# third_parties_login
Very simple login system via third parties (Yandex & Tg)

Yandex integration - https://oauth.yandex.com (Get ClientID and Client secret); 
Tg integration - https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login (Create own bot via Gotfather and and with coommand "/setdomain" set your domain for the bot)

Used django-allauth package, simply overrode login and logout templates (for simplification purposes) (Docs https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/)
